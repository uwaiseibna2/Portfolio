I am a PhD candidate at Florida Atlantic University. My research focuses on developing novel methodologies that fuse novel machine-learning techniques with complex biological data modeling. I have worked on models that learn genotype-phenotype associations solely based on the gaps in a multi-species sequence alignment. In my previous project, I worked on social computing method to predict substance abuse vulnerability. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between computational and biological sciences, paving the way for transformative applications in genomics and beyond.
